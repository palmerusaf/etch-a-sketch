# Etch-A-Sketch

This webpage simulates an etch-a-sketch toy by changing the background color of div boxes when the mouse hovers over them.

## Features
* Reset button deletes the current grid.
* Reset button also prompts user for dimensions to create a new grid. Example: input of 16 would make a 16x16 grid.
* On mouse hover grid elements change to a random color.
* Each mouse hove darkens the grid elements by 10% resulting in a black element after 10 hovers.

## Limitations
* Since the elements rely on a mouse hover this webpage currently does not work well on mobile.
* The size of the grid is limited to 100x100 to prevent performance issues.
